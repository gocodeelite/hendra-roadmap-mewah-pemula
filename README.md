## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

  * **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager, typically installed with Node.js)
      * We recommend using [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for easy Node.js version management.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gocodeelite/hendra-roadmap-mewah-pemula.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd hendra-roadmap-mewah-pemula
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reloading and a live preview, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically open your application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
